                                done. Many times she has gone above and beyond
                                the call of duty and wouldn&#39;t accept anything
                                additional from us. I think of her as another member
                                of our family and completely trust her with my
                                precious parent. Cindy is smart, caring professional

                                away in 2006.</span> She helped my mother file
                                for benefits he had left her, find her social
                                security card and file for social security benefits,

                                billings and medicare benefits from her husband&#39;s

                                her move and decorated her apartment. She arranged

                                doctors and dentists and hospital tests, to speak
                                for my mother and help her understand and let me
